## üî• Key Features

This isn't just your average password generator. Here's a rundown of what it can do:

#### **Basic & Advanced Controls**
* **Length & Count**: Tweak the password length (8-32 chars) and the number of passwords to generate at once (1-8).
* **Comprehensive Character Sets**:
    * **Standard**: Numbers (`0-9`), Lowercase (`a-z`), Uppercase (`A-Z`), and common Symbols (`$%&@#`).
    * **Special**: Accent characters (`√Å√°√â√©`), Currencies (`‚ÇΩ‚Ç¨¬•¬£`), Mathematical (`¬±√ó√∑‚à´`), and Physics (`Œ±Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥Œµ`).
* **Exclusion Options**:
    * Exclude similar-looking characters to avoid confusion (`1IiLlOo0`).
    * Exclude ambiguous characters that can break formatting (`~,.:;^`).
    * Ensure no duplicate characters are used at all.
    * Prevent consecutive duplicate characters.

#### **Power-User Customization**
* **Prefix & Suffix**: Add custom text to the beginning or end of your passwords.
* **Must-Include Characters**: Force the output to contain specific characters you need.
* **Must-Exclude Characters**: Ban specific characters from ever appearing in the output.
* **Reset Button**: Quickly clear all custom options with a single click.

#### **Real-time Strength Analysis**
* **Security Score**: Each password is analyzed using Dropbox's **zxcvbn** library, scoring it from 0 (very weak) to 4 (very strong).
* **Visual Strength Bar**: An intuitive color-coded bar (red to blue) visually represents the password's strength.
* **Crack Time Estimation**: Get a realistic estimate of how long it would take to crack your password.
* **Suggestions & Warnings**: Receive helpful feedback and suggestions to make your password even better.

#### **Premium User Experience (UX)**
* **Light & Dark Mode**: A comfortable viewing experience at any time of day, with your theme preference saved automatically.
* **One-Click Copy**: Easily copy any password to your clipboard.
* **Session Persistence**: Generated passwords remain even after a page reload, preventing accidental loss.
* **Exit Confirmation**: Get a warning before closing the tab with generated passwords, ensuring you don't lose important results.
* **Toast Notifications**: Clear, non-intrusive feedback for actions like "Copied!" or "Options Reset."
* **Persistent Settings**: All your preferences are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so you don't have to set them up again on every visit.
